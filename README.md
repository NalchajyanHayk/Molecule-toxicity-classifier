# Molecule-Toxicity-Classifier

Molecule Toxicity Classifier
This project implements a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying molecules based on their toxicity. The model is trained using molecular data represented as SMILES strings, and the classification is binary: whether a molecule is "Toxic" or "Non-Toxic."

Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the code:

### torch
### pandas
### numpy
### scikit-learn
### matplotlib
### rdkit
